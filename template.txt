I have a certificate in UI/UX Design earned through Coursera's practical-based competent course.
Through the course and working on personal projects, I have grasped some major aspects of interface design such as: User-centered design, User Empathy, Typography & Iconography, Information Architecture, Design Iteration, Prototyping, and User Research.

As a creatuve UI/UX Designer, I create positively memorable and intuitive experiences for web, mobile, and desktop software users by applying strategic and innovative approaches. This serves the interests of both providers and users of the technologies.
I also have a working knowledge in Figma and Adobe XD, which I have used to deliver the projects that are linked below.

I am currently freelancing and working on personal projects as I look for an organization to offer my UI/UX Design services.
