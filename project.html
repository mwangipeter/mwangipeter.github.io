            <p>
              E-farmer is an application that aggregates all the existing agricultural technologies for easy access by the farmers. Several technological solutions exist in the agricultural sector but a large number of farmers are not aware of these technologies or the means of accessing them.

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>
              <ol class="ol">
                <p>Conduct user research.</p>
                <p>Design the interface.</p>
                <p>Prototyping.</p>
                <p>Iterating the design.</p>
              </ol>

            <h3>Duration and Procedure</h3>
            <p>
              December 2021 - January 2022.<br>
              The procedure involved was collecting data to see if the solution will be of help to the farmers. The data was collected and anallyzed by a team member who we were working with in this project.
            </p>
            <h3>Progress and Future Steps</h3>
            <p>
              The application is now in the final design stages where we have the high fidelity prototype ready for the display.

            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p>
              <p>Unmoderated usability study.</p>
              <p>Location: Kenya (the participants will do the study remotely via Google forms).</p>
              <p>Sessions will take place remotely any time a user has access to the form.</p>
              <p>Five or more participants will undertake the study completing various tasks on the flow: sign up, login, use of search button, selection of a value chain.</p>
              <p>The user has about 45 minutes to complete the session.</p>
            </p>
            <h3>Participants</h3>
            <p>
              Participants are farmers who have access to Internet connection, a smart phone, and who use or want to start using technology to boost their agricultural activites.
            </p>
            <h3>Scripts</h3>
              <p>Prompt 1: Sign Up </p>
                
                  <p>&emsp; Prompt 1 Follow-up: How easy was it to create your profile?</p>
                  <p>&emsp; Did you encounter any challenge in the process?</p>
                  <p>&emsp; How long did it take you?</p>          
              <p>Prompt 2: Select a value addition chain.
                
                  <p>&emsp; Were you able to find what you wanted?</p>
                  <p>&emsp; How can we improve that procedure?</p>
                  <p>&emsp; How fast were you able to do that?</p>

              UX Research Study Plan
            </h2>
            <h3>Title and Purpose</h3>
            <p>
              <b>E-Farmer</b> is an application seeking to bring the various services that farmers need into a central place. The results will be faster access and having a variety from which the users can choose from.
