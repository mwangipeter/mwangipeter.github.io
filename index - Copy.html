              I am creative in my work with the mission of delivering intuitive user interfaces to give users a seamless experience with digital products across various platforms.</p> -->
             <p> As a budding UI/UX Designer, I create positively memorable and intuitive experiences for web, mobile, and desktop software users by applying strategic and innovative approaches. This serves the interests of both providers and users of the technologies.

            </p>
            <p>I have a certificate in UI/UX Design earned through Coursera's practical-based competent course.Through the course and working on personal projects, I have grasped some major aspects of interface design such as: User-centered design, User Empathy, Typography & Iconography, Information Architecture, Design Iteration, Prototyping, and User Research.</p>

<p>My working knowledge is in Figma and Adobe XD tools, which I have used to deliver the projects that are linked below.</p>

<p>I am currently freelancing and working on personal projects as I look for an organization to offer my UI/UX Design services.</p>
